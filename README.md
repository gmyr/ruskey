# Ruskey

![Build and Test](https://github.com/gmyr/ruskey/workflows/Build%20and%20Test/badge.svg?branch=main)

An (incomplete) interpreter for the [Monkey](https://monkeylang.org/) programming language written in Rust.

I use this as a playground to learn Rust while following along with the book [Writing An Interpreter In Go](https://interpreterbook.com/) by [Thorsten Ball](https://thorstenball.com/).
